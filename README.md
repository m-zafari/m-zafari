## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔎 Knowledge Distillation For Image Classification
Developed knowledge distillation networks in PyTorch to improve student model performance on image classification datasets (Stanford40, CIFAR100) using attention-based feature distillation. Implemented custom data loaders and experimented with various teacher-student model pairs.

### 🧠 Digit Recognition With MNIST Dataset
Built multilayer perceptron (MLP) models using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Compared activation functions and optimizers for performance analysis.

### 📊 Clustering Algorithms Comparison
Compared K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN on synthetic datasets. Evaluated using Rand Index, Jaccard Index, Silhouette Score, and Dunn Index.

### ⚙️ Compare Optimization Algorithms
Implemented and compared Gradient Descent and Newton's Method on nonlinear functions in Python. Analyzed convergence and visualized optimization paths.

### 🏨 Implementing a Hotel Chain Database
Designed a relational database system for hotel chain management (15+ interrelated tables) with SQL queries, normalization, and data integrity enforcement.

### 🍬 Candy Store Simulation
Simulated candy store operations using SimPy — modeled customer arrivals, queues, cashier service, and analyzed key performance metrics.
